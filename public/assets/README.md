# Placeholder for app icon files

This directory contains the application icons for the desktop app:

- icon.png - PNG icon for Linux
- icon.ico - ICO icon for Windows  
- icon.icns - ICNS icon for macOS

Since we can't generate actual icon files in this environment, these would need to be created separately with proper dental clinic branding.

The icon should be:
- 512x512 pixels for best quality
- Simple, recognizable dental clinic symbol
- Professional appearance matching the app theme
